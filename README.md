android-utils
=============

This project includes a couple of classes with useful utility-methods
for android application development:

	* AndroidUtils contains general helpers (such as showing a simple Alert Dialog)
	* JSONArrayList wraps a JSONArray into an iterable Collection (for use with Functional.java or just simple foreach-loops)
	* StringUtils contains android specific helper methods (such as localizing a format-string)
